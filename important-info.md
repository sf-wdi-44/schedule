## Course Information

### Class Hours
Class runs from 9am-5pm daily, with a one hour lunch break. Being more than 15 minutes late counts as a tardy, as does leaving class more than 15 minutes early. (We will often have a soft end to the day, where you're working on a lab at the end of the day and as homework, and we won't care about you leaving early; but that shouldn't be assumed, especially early in the course.)

### Homework
We will post the lecture materials each night for the next day. It's a good idea to skim or read those materials, as they'll prepare you for the lecture we'll do in class. However, you should NOT start working on labs or writing code based on the next day's materials; if you do, you'll lose the opportunity to work on that lab with your classmates the next day.

You should also be checking the [homework page](homework.md) every night. That's where we'll include which labs you should complete and any additional tasks that will be helpful to you for the next day.

### Feedback
We will provide significant written feedback on your major projects, and a mixture of written and verbal feedback on homework assignments and weekend labs. Anything that is on GitHub is "fair game" for us to look at and give you feedback on, or for a code review.

### 1:1s
You will have mandatory 1:1s with both instructors in the first two weeks of the course. After that, you can sign up for more 1:1s at will by entering your name in the Google sheet.
