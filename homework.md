- Finish Personal API and get ready to present on it Monday morning. You must have:
	- GET route for '/api/profile'
	- GET route for 'api/whateverYourModelIs'
	- POST route for 'api/whateverYourModelIs' 
	- Heroku link from which to present your front-end (should have AJAX calls to all your 3 endpoints and show them on the page)
	- IMPORTANT: Don't worry about the '/api' endpoint in the directions
- RECOMMENDED BONUS: Code last night's function exercises again from scratch to practice

## Thurs, March 29
- Finish Sprint 0 ~ Sprint 1 of the Tunely Project
- Code the following functions in a REPL *Submit REPL link in Project Submission Doc, under Whiteboarding Practice I*
	- Function called `namesWithFiveOrMoreChars` that takes in an array of objects like `[{name: 'Tina'}, {name: 'Christine'}, {name: 'Terry'}]` and outputs just the objects with names over 5 characters like `[{name: 'Christine'}, {name: 'Terry'}]` (think of `.filter()`!)
	- Function called `nameLengths` that takes in an array of objects like `[{name: 'Tina'}, {name: 'Christine'}, {name: 'Terry'}]` and outputs an array of name lengths like `[4, 9, 5]` (think of `.map()`!)
	- Function called `getMostFrequentLetter` that takes in a word and finds the most frequently used letter – don't worry about ties (hmm, deja vu..)
	- Function called `countVowels` that takes in a word and counts how many vowels there are in that word (more deja vu..)
	- Function called `getMostFrequentVowel` that takes in a word and finds the most frequently used vowel – don't worry about ties

Some boilerplate for you to use:
```js
var people = [{name: 'Tina'}, {name: 'Christine'}, {name: 'Terry'}];

let namesWithFiveOrMoreChars = () => {}

let nameLengths = () => {}

let getMostFrequentLetter = () => {}

let countVowels = () => {}

let getMostFrequentVowel = () => {}

// make sure your functions work for these invoked expressions
namesWithFiveOrMoreChars(people); // should return [{name: 'Christine'}, {name: 'Terry'}]
nameLengths(people); // should return [4, 9, 5]
getMostFrequentLetter('Lilac'); // should return 'l'
countVowels('Apple'); // should return 2
getMostFrequentVowel('Elephant'); // should return 'e'
```

## Wed, March 28
- Finish Sprint 3 of Book App
- Review Book App LIKE YOUR LIFE DEPENDS ON IT (just kidding, just your next 2 projects do)

## Tues, March 27

- Continue implementing feedback on your Personal Portfolio Project – requirements [here](https://github.com/sf-wdi-44/personal-portfolio/blob/master/README.md#deliverables)

## Mon, March 26
- [Test-driven Todo App](https://github.com/sf-wdi-labs/test-driven-todo-api)
	- Fork and clone to your machine
	- Follow instructions up until this point:
	```
	0 passing (84ms)
	9 failing
	```
	- Make sure you are seeing the output that says `9 failing`!
- Review the Node.js / Express.js labs we did today. Make sure you are solid on the following concepts:
	- What is `package.json`? What command do I run to create one?
	- What command do I run to install a dependency like `express`?
	- What are the `/node_modules`?
	- Why is it best practice to put `/node_modules` inside our `.gitignore` file? (Please Google-fu your way through this!)
	- What is the difference between Node.js and Express.js?
	- What role do routes play in a server-side application?
	- How do I start a Node server? What is the benefit of using `nodemon`?
	- What is the difference between `req.params` vs. `req.query`?
	- What are the 4 HTTP methods you'd use for a server-side application?
	- Why is it best practice to put `/api` in front of API routes?
	- Each Node route takes in a callback function that looks like `function(request, response) { ... }` – are `request` and `response` keywords I have to use, or "potato" words?
	- What is the difference between `res.send` and `res.json`?

## Thurs, March 15
- Finish Kyrel (Part III)
- Use [repl.it](https://repl.it/languages/javascript) as a sandbox to write the functions below – *Submit your repl.it URL in Project Submission Doc*
	- `countZeros` – counts how many 0s there are in an array
		- ex: `countZeros([0, 2, 0, 6, 4, 0]) // => 3`
	- `addUpTo` – adds all numbers up to a given max number
	    - ex. `addUpTo(5) // => 15 (bc 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15`
	    - Hint: define a `var currentSum = 0;` variable in the beginning, and keep adding to it as you loop through all the numbers in the array
	- `getPersonSentence` – formats an object (with `name`, `age`, and `city` keys) into a sentence
	    - ex. `getPersonSentence({name: ’Sam’, age: 28, city: 'Los Angeles'}) // => 'Sam is 28 years old and lives in Los Angeles'`
	- `getNames` – takes in an array of objects (with `name` and `age` keys), and prints out each object’s name
	    - ex: `getNames([{name: ’Sam’, age: 20}, {name: ’Charlotte’, age: 30}, {name: ’Dany’, age: 40}]) => [‘Sam’, ‘Charlotte’, ‘Dany’]`
	- `getDifference` – takes in an array of numbers and returns a sentence with the highest number, lowest number, and the difference between them
	    - ex: `getDifference([5, 2, 3, 8, 1]) // => 'The highest number is 8. The lowest number is 1. The difference is 7'`
	    
	- `countVowels` – counts how many vowels there are in an array
		- ex: `countVowels(['a', 'b', 'u', 'c', 'g', 'o']) // => 3`
		- Hint: declare a `var vowels = [‘a’, ‘e’, ‘i', ‘o’, ‘u’]` variable
		- Hint: use JavaScript’s `.indexOf()` function to test if a letter is in that `vowels` array (look up how `.indexOf()` works, if you are not sure!)
	- `getPersonSentence_v2` – formats an object (with `name`, `yearOfBirth`, and `city` keys) into a sentence
	    - ex. `getPersonSentence_v2({name: ’Sam’, yearOfBirth: 1990, city: 'Los Angeles'}) // => 'Sam is 28 years old and lives in Los Angeles'`
	- `getLongestName` – takes in an array of objects (with `name` and `age` keys), and prints out the longest name
	    - ex: `getLongestName([{name: ’Sam’, age: 20}, {name: ’Charlotte’, age: 30}, {name: ’Dany’, age: 40}]) => ‘Charlotte’`
	    - Hint: Use the previously written `getNames()` function to help you

    - returns the word 'fizzbuzz' for each number in the array that is divisible by both 3 and 5
